# sms_friend

This repository contains a friend you can talk to over SMS. It's a Flask app, using the SQLAlchemy ORM, gpt-4o for intelligence, and Twilio for texting.

At the present moment, it's not yet deployed. In many ways, `sms_friend` is a work in progress!

## Ideas:

- more personality: we want our friends to be quite interesting!
- name awareness: a friend would ask about your name and remember it
- shared context memory: a friend knows things about all its conversations at any given moment
- 0-N text responses: our friends might not text us back, or might respond with a couple messages
- delayed text responses: a friend will generally only respond immediately for urgent texts
